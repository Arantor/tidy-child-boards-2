# Tidy Child Boards 2.0

This mod for SMF 2.0 lets you rearrange the list of boards so instead
of having all the 'child boards' in a long comma-separated list under
a board, it rearranges it into a nice multi-column list.

Version 1 was popular enough with over 10,000 downloads but it had
one fundamental problem I never addressed at the time: it still
required theme edits, not that it ever actually needed them.

Version 2 sets out to do the same job without the theme edits, and
generally do a nicer modding job; some of the foibles of v1 were
the result of trying to be relatively compatible with 1.1 and 2.0,
this version is for 2.0 only.

It probably won't play particularly nicely with other board index
modifications but there's only so much that can be done about that.

# Disclaimer

 * This is for 2.0 only.
 * Don't expect a lot of support. It took me nearly 7 years to do this
   update. Don't expect your favourite feature to emerge now.
